# Codeforces Problem Suggester
A poject to help better visualize the progress of a user on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and suggest problems which will help improve their ratings. On [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) the rating to a user is given by computing their [Elo rating](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/102) which is a relative rating system. We try to assign rating to the questions using the same [Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) rating system and generate user rating profile. After that we visualize the questions solved by the user based on different tags and help users to predict which problems to solve so they can best improve their ratings.

To-do:<br>
1. Better Gui<br>
2. Add more features<br>
3. Better ways of predicting questions to solve.<br>
